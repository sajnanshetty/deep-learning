## SESSION4 assignment:

## Target is to achieve 99.4% accuracy using less than 20k parameters using MNSIT data set.

## Solution: Using below approachs achieved 99.52% accuracy with parameters 18,106
   *Used number of kernels 16 in each layer and also 2 times max pooling.
   *Adding Batch Normalization and Drop out 0.05% in each layer except last convolution block.
   *The target is achieved without using Fully Connected and GAP layer.
