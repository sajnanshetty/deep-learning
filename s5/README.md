  * Set the Transforms
  * Set Basic Working Code
  * Set Basic Training  & Test Loop
Results:
  * Parameters: 6.3M
  * Batch size: 128
  * ephoch: 20
  * Best Training Accuracy: 100.00
  * Best Test Accuracy: 99.30
Analysis:
  * Extremely Heavy Model for such a problem
  * Model is over-fitting, but we are changing our model in the next code
	
	
### Code2: Created lighter code
Target:
  * Achieve 99.4% accuracy using lighter code.
  * Set the Transforms
  * Set Basic Working Code
  * Set Basic Training  & Test Loop
Results:
  * Parameters: 10.7k
  * Batch size: 32
  * ephoch: 15
  * Best Training Accuracy: 99.29
  * Best Test Accuracy: 98.6
Analysis:
  * Model is is under fitting.
  * Even model pushed further the test accuracy will not be able to meet the target.
	
### Code2: Created with lighter code with batch normalization
Target:
  * Achieve 99.4% accuracy using lighter code.
  * Set the Transforms
  * Set Basic Working Code
  * Set Basic Training  & Test Loop
  * Applied Batch Normalization
Results:
  * Parameters: 10.9k
  * Batch size: 128
  * ephoch: 15
  * Best Training Accuracy: 99.77
  * Best Test Accuracy: 99.20
Analysis:
  * Model is is over fitting.
  * The train accuracy is meeting the target accuracy.
  * Even model pushed further the test accuracy will not be able to meet the target.
	
### Code3: Apply Reguralization using droup out
Target:
  * Achieve 99.4% accuracy using lighter code.
  * Set the Transforms
  * Set Basic Working Code
  * Set Basic Training  & Test Loop
  * Applied Batch normalization.
  * Applied Drop out with .05%
Results:
  * Parameters: 10.9k
  * Batch size: 128
  * ephoch: 15
  * Best Training Accuracy: 98.88
  * Best Test Accuracy: 99.06
Analysis:
  * Model is is not over fitting.
  * Used 15 epochs to train model could not meet target accuracy.
  * If model pushed further the test accuracy will be able to meet the target.
	
### Code4: Apply GAP
Target:
  * Achieve 99.4% accuracy using lighter code.
  * Set the Transforms
  * Set Basic Working Code
  * Set Basic Training  & Test Loop
  * Applied Batch normalization.
  * Applied Drop out with .05%
  * Applied GAP
Results:
  * Parameters: 6k
  * Batch size: 128
  * ephoch: 15
  * Best Training Accuracy: 96.12
  * Best Test Accuracy: 98.76
Analysis:
  * Model is not over fitting.
  * This works better.But Model did not meet the target accuracy.
  * This model is very well trained even with less parameters.
	
### Code5: Apply Image Augumentaion maintaining parameters below 10k
Target:
  * Achieve 99.4% accuracy using lighter code.
  * Set the Transforms
  * Set Basic Working Code
  * Set Basic Training  & Test Loop
  * Applied Batch normalization
  * Applied GAP
  * Added LR scheduler with step of 1
  * Applied Image Augumentaion with degree 9
