## Goal :
```
 1. Task1:
```
 *  Download [this](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip) TINY IMAGENET (Links to an external site.) dataset. 
 *  Training ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy.  
```
 1. Task2:  
```
 * Download 50 images of dogs. 
 * Use [this](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via_demo.html) to annotate bounding boxes around the dogs.
 * Download JSON file. 
 * Find out the best total numbers of clusters. Upload link to your Colab File uploaded to GitHub. 


##Task2:  Annotation

### Normalized data of annotation

### Cluster data
![cluster](https://github.com/sajnanshetty/deep-learning/blob/master/s12/annotation/cluster_3.PNG)

### elbow method to find out best k value, From graph we can decide that '3' is a best fi value.
